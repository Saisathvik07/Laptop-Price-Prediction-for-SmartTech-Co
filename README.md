# Laptop-Price-Prediction-for-SmartTech-Co 
This project shows a Laptop price prediction system by using the supervised machine learning technique. The research uses random decision forest as the machine learning prediction method which offered 88.7% prediction precision.

Using random decision forest, there are multiple independent variables but one and only one dependent variable whose actual and predicted values are compared to find precision of results.

This project proposes a system where price is dependent variable which is predicted, and this price is derived from factors like Laptop’s model, RAM, ROM (HDD/SSD), GPU, CPU, IPS Display, and Touch Screen.
